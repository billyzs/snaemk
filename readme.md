# A simple kmeans algorithm that works with STL containers
## Requirements
* a c++14 compiler (tested with gcc 8.2)
* STL
* containers that provide iterators (ideally, RandomAccess iterators); `std::vector` and `std::array` both work
* numeric types that are closed under addition, and multipliable with floating point types
* CMake and GTest for unit test
